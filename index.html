<!-- Refactored Flexbox code to work with mobile and desktop and added media query for tablet -->
<!-- I had to get rid of everything and start with a class of box -->
<!-- Once I had all boxes working, I was able to separate into groups. Starting with E-H -->
<!-- E-H became one unit, so I had to look at the other boxes that needed to be grouped together
    C-D needed to be a unit, so they were grouped together -->
<!-- Had to ZOOM OUT and saw that clyde and efgh and i acted as a unit so they all went in a container called Moe -->
<!-- Had to zoom out again, and saw that b and Moe also acted as a unit, so they were placed in the container Bonnie -->
<!-- When I say "unit" they are a group that changed their positions when these breakpoints occurred -->
