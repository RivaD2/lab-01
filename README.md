# lab-01
## SMACSS and Responsive Design lab

**Overview:Build a single responsive web page based off of the provided design comp assets. The comp assets contain images of what I would strive to build in HTML and CSS.**

* This web page had to be designed in a mobile-first approach and responsive when the screen size changes and the page is refreshed. The breakpoint had to be at 768 pixels.
* I used good HTML structure to scaffold this site and used semantic elements where possible.
* Added a `reset.css` file 
* Used SMACSS-style modularity to organize CSS.
* Styled the page using float-based layout to reflect the comp images provided as closely as possible. The only text I could have in each box was the identifying letter, which had to be centered horizontally and vertically.
* For the desktop view, the content had to be inside a channel with a maximum of 960 pixels wide and is centered on wider screen sizes.
* Each box had to have a unique background color in mobile view and in desktop view. 

# lab 4a RWD Practice
**Overview: In lab 1, I built a web page where each box of content was rendered with a unique color in desktop view and in mobile view. I had to complete this assigment again, using either Flexbox or CSS grids for styling. I chose Flexbox**

* When the user changes the size of the viewport,the boxes scale proportionally and change colors
* Used Flexbox for styling this application.
* Used relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
* Used at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There are three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device.
